# Edge-detection-video-playback

Principle: opencv, an edge detection algorithm for carry operators
1. First of all, you need to prepare a goddess split view original video (mine was recorded by myself)
2. Convert the video to a picture frame by frame, and extract the sound in the video (that is, the two codes of video to picture and sound extraction)
3. Calculate each picture and output it, playing the sound at the same time.

Tools: opencv processing images, winsound playing sounds, moviepy extracting sounds.

About: Up Lord is just a regular python-loving player who wrote the code out of interest
The core code as a whole is edge detection of the image, so it can also be used to play other videos.

原理：opencv，carry算子的边缘检测算法
1.首先需要准备一个神女劈观原视频（我的是自己录制的）
2.将视频逐帧转为图片，并将视频中的声音提取出来（即视频转图片和声音提取两个代码）
3.对每一张图片进行计算然后输出，同时播放声音。

工具：opencv处理图像，winsound播放声音，moviepy提取声音。

关于：up主只是一个爱好python的普通玩家，出于兴趣写了这些代码
整体的核心代码即为图像的边缘检测，因此也可以用来播放其他视频。
